Preview: The purpose of this algorithm is to create a program that places 8 queens on an 8x8 board where none of the queens are in conflict with each other. You
are to implement the solution by using the Hill-Climbing algorithm with random restarts.

Algorithm Description: The 8-Queens problem requires that 8 queens be placed on a board with 8 rows and columns so that no queen occupies
the same row, column or diagonal as another queen. To solve this problem using the Hill-Climbing with random restart
algorithm, we must first generate a random starting state which places a queen in a random row of each column. From
there, we first check to see if the state is a goal state (no queens are in conflict). If not, we evaluate all of the possible
neighbor states by moving each columnâ€™s queen through the rows of its column and generating a heuristic value for
each of those states. When all of the neighbor states have been generated, we check to see if any states were
generated that have a lower heuristic value than the current state. If a better state was not found, then we have
reached the local minima and must perform a random restart. If a better (lower heuristic) state was found, then that
state becomes the current state and the above process is repeated on that state.
